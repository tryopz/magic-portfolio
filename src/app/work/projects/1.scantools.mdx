## Overview

ScanTools is an advanced batch image editor developed as an academic project at ESIEE Paris. Over five months, our team—Alex Foulon, Clément Zelter, Gabriel Rouleau, and myself—focused on building a tool that combines performance, flexibility, and real-world impact. ScanTools surpasses commercial alternatives in both speed and adaptability, and is now used by studios and professionals to streamline photogrammetry pipelines.

## Key Features

- **Lighting Correction** – Remove lighting inconsistencies for cleaner albedo textures.
- **Blurry Image Detection** – Automatically flag and filter low-quality input images.
- **Automatic Subject Segmentation** – Precisely isolate subjects from backgrounds.
- **Roughness Map Extraction** – Generate roughness maps from cross-polarized datasets for enhanced material realism.
- **Batch Processing** – Process large datasets efficiently with robust automation.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: High-performance core logic and image processing.
- **OpenCV**: Advanced computer vision and image manipulation.
- **OpenImageIO**: Fast, flexible image I/O and format support for batch workflows.
- **FFmpeg**: Automated video and image sequence processing for export and integration.
